# Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification

[View the spec][playground]

The Ethereum JSON-RPC is a collection of methods that all clients implement.
This interface allows downstream tooling and infrastructure to treat different
Ethereum clients as modules that can be swapped at will.

## Building

The specification is split into multiple files to improve readability. It
can be compiled the spec into a single document as follows:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
Build successful.
```

This will output the file `openrpc.json` in the root of the project. This file
will have all schema `#ref`s resolved.

## Contributing

The specification is written in [OpenRPC][openrpc]. Refer to the
OpenRPC specification and the JSON schema specification to get started.

### Testing

There are currently three tools for testing contributions. The main two that
run as GitHub actions are an [OpenRPC validator][validator] and a
[spellchecker][spellchecker]:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run lint
OpenRPC spec validated successfully.

$ pip install pyspelling
$ pyspelling -c spellcheck.yaml
Spelling check passed :)
```

The third tool can validate a live JSON-RPC provider hosted at
`http://localhost:8545` against the specification:

```console
$ ./scripts/debug.sh eth_getBlockByNumber \"0xc7d772\",false
data.json valid
```
